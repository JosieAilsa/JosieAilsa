:woman_technologist: I was first introduced to coding when, working with a digital agency, I launched and latterly managed, an editorial website as part of my day-to-day comms job at a large FMCG company.

🔒 In the depths of COVID lockdown 2021, I wanted to use my new found spare time productively, so began learning HTML and CSS. 
 
 :rocket: Fast-forward three years (and a lot of late nights later!), I've switched careers for a fully-fledged role in software development.
