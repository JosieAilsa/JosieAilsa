- 👋 Hi, I’m @Josie
- 👀 I’m a content designer and writer. My day to day role introduced me to web design and developmet when I helped design and launch a new website. So to explore this field further, I enrolled on a front-end development course so I could study around my full time role. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will build my skill set!
