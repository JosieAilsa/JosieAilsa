:woman_technologist: I was first introduced to coding when, working with a digital agency, I launched and latterly managed, an editorial website as part of my day-to-day comms job at a large FMCG company.

ðŸ”’ When lockdown 2020 hit, with all my new-found spare time I began learning HTML and CSS, and haven't looked back since!
