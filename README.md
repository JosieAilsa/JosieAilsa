:woman_technologist: I was first introduced to coding when, working with a digital agency, I launched and latterly managed, a research website as part of my day-to-day comms job at large FTSE 30 company. You can see some of my writing and design work here: <a href = "https://imperialbrandsscience.com/blog/talking-tobacco-harm-reduction-and-a-world-beyond-smoke"> here </a>. When lockdown 2020 hit, with all my new-found spare time I began learning HTML and CSS, and haven't looked back since!
 
 :rocket: In late 2021, I left my previous job as a corporate content writer- for a fully-fledged career in tech.
 
 :computer: I'm now a junior software coach at _nology â€“Â a Bristol-based training center â€“ helping others learn to code too. 
 
 ðŸŒ± Alongside my new role, I'm now learning Java & Spring Boot.
