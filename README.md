 :woman_technologist: Lockdown #1 2020 encouraged me to enhance my digital skill set. With all my new-found spare time I began learning HTML and CSS, and haven't looked back since!
 
 :rocket: In late 2021, I left my previous job as a corporate content writer for a fully-fledged career in tech.
 
 :computer: I'm now a junior software coach at _nology â€“Â a Britsol-based training center â€“ helping others learn to code too. 
 
 ðŸŒ± Alongside my new role, I'm learning React, Java & Spring Boot.
