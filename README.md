- 👋 Hi, I’m @JosieAilsa
- 👀 I’m a content creator and writer, but I've recently discovered a passion for UI design and development. I recently enrolled on a front-end development course so I could study around my full time role. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will build my skill set!
- 📫 Reach me on josie.a.newman@gmail.com
